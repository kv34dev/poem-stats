# My Poetry Statistics

**MPS** is a personal project created out of my passion for poetry and data visualization. It’s a digital showcase of the poems I’ve written, presented in a visually appealing style.

The project uses a modern “liquid glass” aesthetic with soft gradients, blurred backgrounds, and subtle shadows to give a clean and elegant look. The poems are categorized by language and topic, providing insight into the composition of my personal collection.

The project is ongoing, with updates planned for new categories, statistics, and visual enhancements. You can view the live project and explore the visual stats of my poems through the link in the About section.
